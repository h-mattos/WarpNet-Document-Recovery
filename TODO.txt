Codebase
- Add images blurred off the base images (Josh WIP)
- Fix performance code to include all scenarios (JOSH WIP)
- Implement 07_dewarping.py: With the trained model, please add both:
    - The unwarping of the data/blurred (blurred+warped) images under data/dewarped
    - The unwarping of the data/deblurred images (so the result will be both deblurred and dewarped) under data/recovered
- Implement early stopping
- Run through both training end-to-end, verify that training performance charts are being produced correctly
- Run experiments (how does hyperparameter tuning affect performance?)
- Update README.md to reflect the final state of our repo

Final Paper
- For every "TODO" in the final paper, add necessary source. (Josh WIP)
- Section 3. Experiments and Results
    - Include plots from training on both networks (from 03.py and 06.py)
    - Include final table of performance metrics (from 08.py)
- Section 4. Other Sections
    - Include any necessary information based on the rubric, either in a separate section or an already-existing section
